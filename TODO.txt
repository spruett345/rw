--- Type system
	- Add better printing support for fancier functions
	- Define some sort of ordering for sorting orderless functions
	- Add negative/nonnegative for multiplied numbers
	- String type
	- As imprecise values
--- Kernel
	- Set some protection on base functions
	- Work with parser to evaluate programs/scripts
--- Parsing
	- Define some grammar for the language
	
--- Pattern matching
	- Some kind of guarded pattern matching
		- Finish this once expression eval done
	- Lookahead based patterns
	- Default valued pattern matching

--- Compiliation/optimzations
	- Potential compilation to custom bytecode
	- Compilation to LINQ expressions for faster evaluation for numerical methods

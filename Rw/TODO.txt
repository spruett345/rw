--- Type system
	- Add better printing support for fancier functions
	- Define some sort of ordering for sorting orderless functions
--- Kernel
	- Define rules
	- Define function attributes
	- Expression evaluation
--- Parsing
	- Write a S exp parser first
	
--- Pattern matching
	- Some kind of guarded pattern matching
	- Backtracking?
		- Finish the normal pattern matching for standard normals
		- Finsih the normal pattern matching for flat&orderless

--- Compiliation/optimzations
	- Potential compilation to custom bytecode
	- Compilation to LINQ expressions for faster evaluation for numerical methods
